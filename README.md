# Book-microservice

This project aims to implement 4 microservices pertaining to serving books as content.


# Instructions
 Run the docker compose yaml file to start.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up`

# System Design

## Features
 - Built a scalable backend system to serve books as contents.
 - Dockerized entire application including all services and databases for easy deployement.
 - Used Nginx as a reverse proxy to cater requests to different services.
 - Used RabbitMQ as the Message-Broker to publish message from User Service to Email Service after which an email 
   will be sent to the newly regsitered user.
 - User can filter books based on the basis of likes or reads interactions.
 - Implemented database using Mongodb for all three services.

 ## User interaction service
 - User Interaction service is basically supposed record events done by the user. In this case the service records 2 types of
   events, Like and Read.
 - Like - The content liked by the current user.
 - Read - The content i.e book completely read by the user.
 - This service exposes API for content service inorder to fetch top contents bases on likes and read since these 2 events data is 
   stored in User_events database.
